This project explores **Transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) models** for text classification and inference using **BERT-base, DistilBERT-base, and RoBERTa-base**.  
The goal is to understand **model behavior, efficiency, and architectural trade-offs** using pre-trained language models.
